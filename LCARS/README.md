# LCARS UI

[LCARS (Library Computer Access/Retrieval System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LCARS) is the iconic science-fiction UI designed by Mike Okuda for Star Trek: The Next Generation and used in all Star Trek productions that take place in the late 24th century. 

Many recreations of LCARS exist as static graphics or as Flash animations. This project shows that one can develop a responsive LCARS interface entirely with modern web technologies. The interface responds to fit any screen and collapses to a minimal form for mobile devices. Even works on [PADDs](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Personal_Access_Display_Device) (ahem, tablets)!

# Snowpack README

> ✨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

**⚠️ NOTE:** Vue 3 testing support is still in progress. This template does not ship with a test runner.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.
It correctly bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Q: What about Eject?

No eject needed! Snowpack guarantees zero lock-in, and CSA strives for the same.
